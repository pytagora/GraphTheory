## Content
This repository is covering some of the topics in the field of graph theory. Main core of the repository is discrete mathematics such as applying different types of algorithms on graphs.
Code solutions are programmed in GAP and MAGMA. These are mathematical programs used by experts in discrete mathematics. Package GAP is preffered for group theory problems while package MAGMA shows its high quality and performance in the field of graph theory. Both of the packages can be used for problems in the field of design theory. 

## GAP
GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra, with particular emphasis on Computational Group Theory. GAP provides a programming language, a library of thousands of functions implementing algebraic algorithms written in the GAP language as well as large data libraries of algebraic objects. See also the overview and the description of the mathematical capabilities. GAP is used in research and teaching for studying groups and their representations, rings, vector spaces, algebras, combinatorial structures, and more. The system, including source, is distributed freely. You can study and easily modify or extend it for your special use.

##  MAGMA
Magma is a large, well-supported software package designed for computations in algebra, number theory, algebraic geometry and algebraic combinatorics. It provides a mathematically rigorous environment for defining and working with structures such as groups, rings, fields, modules, algebras, schemes, curves, graphs, designs, codes and many others. Magma also supports a number of databases designed to aid computational research in those areas of mathematics which are algebraic in nature.
